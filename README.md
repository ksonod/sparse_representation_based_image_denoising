# About this Repository
This repository shows an image denoising method based on sparse representation [[1](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-7011-4), [2](https://www.edx.org/certificates/professional-certificate/israelx-sparse-representations-from-theory-to-practice)].  

# How to Use
1. Open [main.py](https://github.com/ksonod/sparse_representation_based_image_denoising/blob/main/sample/main.py) in `./sample` and specify `config` dictionaries.
2. Run `./sample/main.py`.
